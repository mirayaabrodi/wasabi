# Wasabi | わさび :jp:

An online educational website where you can learn fluent Japanese and have access to it at all times :tada:

## The Background Behind This Project :open_book:

This was my very first project and I wanted to be creative in it. So the idea popped right into my head: An online educational website where you can learn fluent Japanese. I wanted the website to look very animated. :paintbrush: :blush:

## What I learned :brain:

- How to create HTML pages and how to create links between them
- How to create a `div` and style the content inside of it
- How to add a `Favicon` to your website with HTML
- Heavily focused on the `float` properties
- Little knowledge of the `transition` property
